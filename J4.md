 # #1 Explain why the following class declaration is not possible in Java.
What are the limitations of the extends key word?
How can you accomplish this inheritance structure task in Java?

## 2 What are some of the functional differences between an abstract class and an interface? Use the example below to answer this question.

## 3 Using those methods in LinkedList complete the realization of a Stack and Queue:
      addToFront(v): to add in  a stack
      return rmfromfront(): removes from the stack
      int front  = rmfromfront(); remove it by getting it
      addtofront(front); 

## 4 Rewrite the Stack and Queue interfaces from above to be generic, as well as the LinkedList. Explain how this is now generic to manage collections of any class.

# # 5 The code below does not use Java generics. Update it to do so. Notably, there should not need casting, but no, the solution isn’t just removing the (String) casting before the .get method.

## 6 What is “Erasure” with java generics? For the code below, what does the code “erase” to?
